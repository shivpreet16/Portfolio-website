  "Hey there! I'm Shivpreet, currently navigating through my Computer Science journey at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, where I'm not just about acing exams with a stellar 9.51 CGPA, but also about squeezing every drop of fun out of life. I'm a fervent video gamer, an enthusiastic badminton player, an avid skater, a chess strategist, and sometimes, a sketch artist (check out my artwork on Instagram for some shameless self-promotion).\n\nMy idea of a good time includes cracking jokes in the tensest moments and watching stand-up comedy — laughter really is the best medicine (sometimes poison in situations where you really don't need to joke)! I love diving into random discussions that have absolutely nothing to do with my career or life goals; it's all about learning and satisfying my curiosity. So, if you're up for a chat about the quirkiest of topics or need a partner to explore new ideas, count me in. Let’s connect and share a laugh or maybe discover something new together!";
