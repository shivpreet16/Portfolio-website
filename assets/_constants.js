  "I am currently working as a Backend Engineer at CliqMetrics. I am pursuing BTech. (2021-2025) at KIIT, Bhubaneshwar in Computer Science and Engineering. I am also a part of the ML Team at GDSC KIIT. Math has intrigued me from a young and in 11th Computer Sience found a soft spot in my heart. I started programming when I was in 8th grade. Most of my experience has been with Web Dev and ML. I am currently focusing on full-stack development and I am aiming to move towards blockchain.";
