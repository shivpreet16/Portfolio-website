export const about =
  `Welcome! I’m Shivpreet, a dedicated and innovative Computer Science student at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, where I have maintained an exceptional CGPA of 9.51/10. My academic journey began at DAV Public School, achieving an impressive 92% aggregate in my 12th CBSE examinations.

Hello! I'm Shivpreet, a Computer Science student at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, deeply interested in the practical applications of emerging technologies. My technical journey includes extensive work with programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, GoLang, and frameworks like React.js, Next.js, and Flask.

I have hands-on experience in backend development, computer vision, deep learning, and data analytics through projects and internships at prestigious institutions. Currently, I'm delving into the realms of genetic algorithms and quantum computing, exploring how these frontier technologies can solve complex problems in innovative ways.

My project portfolio features works like 'ThirdEye', a decentralized video sharing platform, and 'Trade Hive', a stock trading app utilizing LSTM for price prediction. Both projects exemplify my ability to integrate advanced machine learning algorithms with modern web technologies.

Let’s connect to explore potential collaborations or just to share insights into the fascinating world of technology!`;
